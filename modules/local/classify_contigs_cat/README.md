# CAT

## Introduction

This process uses the [Contig Annotation Tool (CAT)](https://github.com/dutilh/CAT) published in [2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31640809/) to taxonomically classify the assembly contigs. The binning annotation tool (BAT) is packaged in this as well but not used for isolate genome assessments.
