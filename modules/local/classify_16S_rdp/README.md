# RDP Classifier

## About this module

This process uses the Ribosomal Data Project (RDP) Classifier to take in 16S rRNA gene sequences and classify them to the genus level. The primary output is a TSV file.

## Classification

This is a rapid classifier, which only takes a few seconds with a single CPU, for 16S sequences developed by [Michigan State University](http://cme.msu.edu/) staff. Currently on [GitHub](https://github.com/rdpstaff/classifier) the source code is several years outdated, but [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/rdp-classifier/) has the latest updates. RDP was first described in [1996](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8594608/) by Carl Woese, has had many updates including MSU-led RDP-II in [2003](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12520046/). RDP's classification algorithm was originally reported in [2007](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17586664/) and its lead author Qiong Wang (https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=9GnT9ZkAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) has made a 2023 release.
