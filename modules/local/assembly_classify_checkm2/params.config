    //  --general    Force the use of the general quality prediction model (gradient boost)
    //  --specific   Force the use of the specific quality prediction model (neural network)

    // From the README.md :
    //   CheckM2 uses two distinct machine learning models to predict genome completeness.
    //   The 'general' gradient boost model is able to generalize well and is intended
    //   to be used on organisms not well represented in GenBank or RefSeq (roughly, when
    //   an organism is novel at the level of order, class or phylum).
    //   The 'specific' neural network model is more accurate when predicting completeness
    //   of organisms more closely related to the reference training set (roughly, when an
    //   organism belongs to a known species, genus or family). 
    //   CheckM2 uses a cosine similarity calculation to automatically determine the 
    //   appropriate completeness model for each input genome, but you can also force 
    //   the use of a particular completeness model, or get the prediction outputs for both.
    //   There is only one contamination model (based on gradient boost) which is applied
    //   regardless of taxonomic novelty and works well across all cases.
