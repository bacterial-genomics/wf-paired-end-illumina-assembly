### About this module

This process uses [CheckM2]https://github.com/chklovski/CheckM2) published in [2023](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37500759/) to assess the full assembly file with a machine learning classfication algorithm for completeness and contamination. Assessment relies on the pre-computed diamond database, where protein fragments are used to train for contamination estimates with gradient boosting (GB) as well as for completeness estimates using neural networks (NN) and GB.

- "CheckM2 was far more accurate for medium, low-quality and highly contaminated genomes than[_sic_] both other [checkm and busco] tools"
